* Quotes
    * ‚ÄúStorytelling is the oldest form of education.‚Äù -- Terry Tempest Williams
    * ‚ÄúA great lasting story is about everyone or it will not last. The strange and foreign is not interesting--only the deeply personal and familiar.‚Äù -- John Steinbeck
    * ‚ÄúA story that contrasts the present with the future needs a great deal of trust.‚Äù -- Doug Rose
    * ‚ÄúNumbers Don‚Äôt Lie, But Charts Do‚Äù
    * ‚ÄúStories activate the same parts of our brains that are activated when processing real experiences.‚Äù 
    * ‚ÄúThe data means nothing without context, without the story form around it.‚Äù -- Bill Shander
    * KWYs -- Bill Shander
        * KWYRWTS "Know What You Really Want to Say"
        * KWYDIS "Know What Your Data is Saying"
        * KWYANTH "Know What Your Audience Needs to Hear"
        * So, your priorities, your audience, your data!
        * The "so what" (the story in the data) is what your audience is there for, not the actual data points themselves.
    * ‚ÄúA story is 22 times more memorable than facts alone.‚Äù -- Jennifer Aaker
    * ‚ÄúASK - Accurate . Story . Knowledge‚Äù -- Bill Shander
    * "Stories make data analysis accessible to a wider audience. They also make analysis more engaging." -- Kubicle.com
* Hints
    * A Power BI dashboard is made up of tiles that, together, tell a story. -- Microsoft
    * Each report page is telling a story. To fully understand the story, you need to know if filters are being applied and what those filters are. -- Microsoft
    * A visual represents a single table, chart or diagram. A dashboard brings together several relaated charts to tell or story about the selected data. -- CFI
    * The human mind is designed to process information visually, and we can often gain better insight more quickly for a well-designed visualization than we can from pages of written text or tables of numbers.
